# Django_Pizza_App
A simple demo of a pizza web application through django

(if you are ok with starting with the default database and you haven't uninstalled it, then skip steps 2 and 3)

to run the app:

1- navigate to the project directory (Where manage.py is located)
2- run in cmd "py manage.py makemigrations" then "py manage.py migrate" to create database
3- run "py manage.py createsuperuser" to create a super user (admin) for the web app, enter the credentials and proceed to the last step
4- run "py manage.py runserver" to start the application

to access admin login page add /admin to the website url after port number

superuser username: admin
password: admin
(unless you created another superuser, use the credentials above)

# Happy Pizza!
